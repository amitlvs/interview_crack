                        Hi, my name is Kanak Sethi. I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics from NIT Surat and
                        I‚Äôm currently working as
                        a Software Developer at Tata Elxsi with 1.9 years of experience in backend development,
                        distributed systems, and cloud
                        infrastructure.
                        Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked extensively on scalable, production-grade systems,
                        particularly in the areas of
                        AI-based video analysis and healthcare SaaS platforms, with a focus on performance optimization,
                        asynchronous
                        processing, and fault-tolerant architectures.

                        <br />
                        üîç AI-Based Live Stream Analysis System
                        In this project, I designed and implemented a CI/CD-driven, real-time content analysis system
                        that detects alcohol
                        consumption, smoking, and abusive behavior in live video streams.
                        * We consumed live streams, chunked them into smaller segments, and processed each chunk through
                        multiple AI models.
                        * I built a Celery + RabbitMQ based pipeline for efficient task distribution and concurrency.
                        * We used MongoDB for metadata, MinIO for chunk storage, and integrated observability and
                        alerting into the pipeline to
                        ensure low latency and high reliability.
                        <br />
                        üè• Healthcare Management System (SaaS-Based)
                        In this project, I led the backend development of a SaaS-based healthcare platform, focusing on
                        modular,
                        microservice-driven architecture.
                        * I developed services for user management, subscription handling, payment integration (Stripe),
                        notifications, and
                        ticketing.
                        * The system supported multi-tenant deployments and was built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL,
                        RabbitMQ, Celery, and
                        S3-compatible object storage.
                        * I also set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, and deployed the system on Kubernetes
                        for scalability and
                        resilience.

                        I‚Äôve had a great experience at Tata Elxsi working on high-impact backend systems, but I‚Äôm now
                        looking for a role that
                        provides more opportunities for technical growth and broader ownership. I want to work in an
                        environment where I can
                        build and scale systems that impact millions of users and challenge me to think beyond just code
                        ‚Äî including
                        architectural decision-making, system design at scale, and leadership responsibilities.
                        What excites me about Amazon is its strong engineering culture, fast-paced innovation, and the
                        way it empowers engineers
                        to take end-to-end ownership. I‚Äôm looking for that next step where I can grow into a more
                        impactful role and contribute
                        to building resilient, customer-first platforms. Amazon feels like the right place to take that
                        leap.

                        <br />
                        * During the Healthcare Management System project, a new teammate joined the team.<br />
                        * He was responsible for writing tests for API endpoints, but struggled with both the
                        business
                        logic and Pytest usage.<br />
                        * This began to slow down the testing phase, risking our sprint delivery.<br />

                        üéØ Task:

                        * Although I wasn‚Äôt assigned to mentor or onboard him, I recognized that helping him would
                        benefit both project velocity
                        and team collaboration.<br />
                        * I took the initiative to ensure he could contribute effectively.<br />

                        <br />
                        * Scheduled a couple of 1-on-1 sessions to explain key service logic and testing
                        approaches.<br />
                        * Walked him through how to write clean and modular tests using Pytest.<br />
                        * Pair-programmed with him on a few test cases to build confidence.<br />
                        * Created a short internal guide summarizing common testing patterns and tools we use.<br />

                        * Test coverage and velocity improved, leading to better release confidence.<br />
                        * The experience strengthened team trust and set a positive tone for future collaboration.<br />

                        RabbitMQ.<br />
                        * Initially, I routed all chunk-processing tasks to a single Celery worker for simplicity,
                        assuming low load during
                        early testing.<br />

                        * As we began testing with real-time live streams, latency increased drastically.<br />
                        * Detection results were delayed, and the AI team raised concerns, questioning the reliability
                        of the architecture.<br />

                        * Re-architected the system to use multi-worker processing and RabbitMQ queue balancing.<br />
                        * Tuned Celery's prefetch count and enabled parallel task handling.<br />
                        * Ran comparative performance tests: single-worker vs. multi-worker setups.<br />
                        * Documented the fix and shared performance metrics with the team.<br />
                        ‚úÖ Result:<br />
                        * Latency dropped by over 60%, restoring real-time performance.<br />

                        * In the Healthcare Management System, we relied solely on email for sending reminders and

                        * Over time, users frequently missed critical emails (e.g., subscription renewals, ticket

                        support queries and delayed user action.<br />
                        * The issue persisted, but no one was actively addressing it.<br />
