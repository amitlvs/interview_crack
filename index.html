                        Hi, my name is Kanak Sethi. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from NIT Surat and
                        I’m currently working as
                        a Software Developer at Tata Elxsi with 1.9 years of experience in backend development,
                        distributed systems, and cloud
                        infrastructure.
                        Over the past few years, I’ve worked extensively on scalable, production-grade systems,
                        particularly in the areas of
                        AI-based video analysis and healthcare SaaS platforms, with a focus on performance optimization,
                        asynchronous
                        processing, and fault-tolerant architectures.

                        💡 Key Projects
                        <br />
                        🔍 AI-Based Live Stream Analysis System
                        In this project, I designed and implemented a CI/CD-driven, real-time content analysis system
                        that detects alcohol
                        consumption, smoking, and abusive behavior in live video streams.
                        * We consumed live streams, chunked them into smaller segments, and processed each chunk through
                        multiple AI models.
                        * I built a Celery + RabbitMQ based pipeline for efficient task distribution and concurrency.
                        * We used MongoDB for metadata, MinIO for chunk storage, and integrated observability and
                        alerting into the pipeline to
                        ensure low latency and high reliability.
                        <br />
                        🏥 Healthcare Management System (SaaS-Based)
                        In this project, I led the backend development of a SaaS-based healthcare platform, focusing on
                        modular,
                        microservice-driven architecture.
                        * I developed services for user management, subscription handling, payment integration (Stripe),
                        notifications, and
                        ticketing.
                        * The system supported multi-tenant deployments and was built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL,
                        RabbitMQ, Celery, and
                        S3-compatible object storage.
                        * I also set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, and deployed the system on Kubernetes
                        for scalability and
                        resilience.

                        I’ve had a great experience at Tata Elxsi working on high-impact backend systems, but I’m now
                        looking for a role that
                        provides more opportunities for technical growth and broader ownership. I want to work in an
                        environment where I can
                        build and scale systems that impact millions of users and challenge me to think beyond just code
                        — including
                        architectural decision-making, system design at scale, and leadership responsibilities.
                        What excites me about Amazon is its strong engineering culture, fast-paced innovation, and the
                        way it empowers engineers
                        to take end-to-end ownership. I’m looking for that next step where I can grow into a more
                        impactful role and contribute
                        to building resilient, customer-first platforms. Amazon feels like the right place to take that
                        leap.

                        Situation:
                        <br />
                        * During the Healthcare Management System project, a new teammate joined the team.<br />
                        * He was responsible for writing tests for API endpoints, but struggled with both the
                        business
                        logic and Pytest usage.<br />
                        * This began to slow down the testing phase, risking our sprint delivery.<br />
                        <br />
                        🎯 Task:
                        <br />
                        * Although I wasn’t assigned to mentor or onboard him, I recognized that helping him would
                        benefit both project velocity
                        and team collaboration.<br />
                        * I took the initiative to ensure he could contribute effectively.<br />
                        <br />
                        🛠️ Action:
                        <br />
                        * Scheduled a couple of 1-on-1 sessions to explain key service logic and testing
                        approaches.<br />
                        * Walked him through how to write clean and modular tests using Pytest.<br />
                        * Pair-programmed with him on a few test cases to build confidence.<br />
                        * Created a short internal guide summarizing common testing patterns and tools we use.<br />
                        <br />
                        ✅ Result:
                        <br />
                        * Within a few days, he was independently writing tests and meeting sprint expectations.<br />
                        * Test coverage and velocity improved, leading to better release confidence.<br />
                        * The experience strengthened team trust and set a positive tone for future collaboration.<br />

                        RabbitMQ.<br />
                        * Initially, I routed all chunk-processing tasks to a single Celery worker for simplicity,
                        assuming low load during
                        early testing.<br />
                        🎯 Task:<br />
                        * As we began testing with real-time live streams, latency increased drastically.<br />
                        * Detection results were delayed, and the AI team raised concerns, questioning the reliability
                        of the architecture.<br />
                        * This impacted their trust in my technical decisions.<br />
                        🛠️ Action:<br />
                        * Took full ownership of the issue and began investigation.<br />
                        * Identified the root cause: task overload on a single worker.<br />
                        * Re-architected the system to use multi-worker processing and RabbitMQ queue balancing.<br />
                        * Tuned Celery's prefetch count and enabled parallel task handling.<br />
                        * Ran comparative performance tests: single-worker vs. multi-worker setups.<br />
                        * Documented the fix and shared performance metrics with the team.<br />
                        ✅ Result:<br />
                        * Latency dropped by over 60%, restoring real-time performance.<br />
                        * The AI team acknowledged the improvement and trust was fully regained.<br />
                        * I was later invited to contribute to performance optimization discussions across other

                        🛠️ Action:<br />

                        * Broke the integration into manageable parts: plan creation, customer setup, and session
                        handling.<br />
                        * Coordinated with the frontend team to align payment flows across the UI and backend.<br />

                        switches.<br />
                        ✅ Result:<br />

                        * In the Healthcare Management System, we relied solely on email for sending reminders and
                        updates to patients.<br />
                        * Over time, users frequently missed critical emails (e.g., subscription renewals, ticket
                        status), leading to repeated
                        support queries and delayed user action.<br />
                        * The issue persisted, but no one was actively addressing it.<br />
                        🎯 Task:<br />
                        * Though it wasn’t assigned to me, I saw this as a recurring issue affecting both user
                        experience and support workload.<br />
                        * I took it upon myself to fix it by creating a more visible and reliable communication

                        🛠️ Action:<br />

                        alerts.<br />
                        * Integrated the system with key modules like subscription and ticketing using RabbitMQ.<br />
                        * Used PostgreSQL to persist messages.<br />
                        * Collaborated with the frontend team to display real-time notifications in the UI.<br />
                        ✅ Result:<br />
                        * Users started getting important alerts inside the application, which led to faster user
                        responses.<br />
                        * Support tickets related to missed emails dropped significantly.<br />
                        * The notification service was adopted by other internal products, and I became the go-to person

                        * While working on the AI-based live stream analysis system, I noticed that batching video
                        chunks before processing was
                        causing high latency.<br />
                        * I suggested processing chunks individually to reduce response time and improve real-time
                        performance.<br />
                        * A senior AI team member disagreed, believing this would negatively impact GPU efficiency and

                        🎯 Task:<br />
                        * My goal was to reduce system latency without compromising model accuracy or performance.<br />

                        the proposed change.<br />

                        🛠️ Action:<br />

                        * Listened to his concerns and acknowledged the trade-offs.<br />
                        * Proposed a test-based comparison of batched vs. non-batched processing.<br />
                        * Created a test environment and collected metrics on:<br />

                        ✅ Result:<br />
                        * The test showed that:<br />
                        * Accuracy remained stable<br />

                        (billing, email, notifications)
                        communicated via synchronous REST APIs.<br />

                        🎯 Task:<br />
                        * My goal was to prove that asynchronous messaging would:<br />

                        🛠️ Action:<br />
                        * Developed a proof of concept comparing REST vs. RabbitMQ under simulated high load.<br />

                        * During a live event test run of the AI-based Live Stream Analysis System, the system started
                        showing increased latency
                        in real-time detection.<br />
                        * This issue risked breaking SLAs (Service Level Agreement) and delayed critical detections like
                        smoking or abusive
                        behavior, which were required to be near real-time.<br />

                        🎯 Task:<br />
                        * I needed to restore low-latency performance immediately, without a full root cause

                        * There wasn’t enough time to experiment with deep optimizations or model reconfiguration.<br />

                        🛠️ Action:<br />
                        * With limited time, I evaluated two options:<br />
                        * Scale up Celery workers to handle more chunks in parallel.<br />
                        * Reduce batch size and re-tune model processing (which would take longer to test).<br />
                        * I quickly chose to scale up Celery workers as a short-term emergency fix to absorb the
                        load.<br />
                        * Monitored metrics in real-time to ensure the system stabilized and latencies dropped.<br />

                        ✅ Result:<br />
                        * The system recovered quickly, restoring real-time performance during the event.<br />

                        * This experience showed that making decisive short-term trade-offs can protect system
